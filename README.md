# Segment.ioTrackingPixelAPISource
This is the unofficial Segment.io Tracking Pixel API that posts data to Segment's Tracking Pixel API source using the GTM Server-sides GA4 client. The template automatically maps all events and user level data into the tracking pixels data schema. It also auto hashes using base64 encryption and posts the required JSON object in the format that the API requires.
